# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Issues Identified
1. **Heavy FeaturesCard component** - Countdown timer running every 1 second
2. **Header animation** - 60fps animation causing performance issues
3. **No lazy loading** - All components loaded at once
4. **Large images** - No optimization for image loading
5. **No Suspense boundaries** - Blocking renders

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Lazy Loading with Suspense
- Added `lazy()` imports for all heavy components
- Wrapped components in `<Suspense>` with loading spinners
- Components now load only when needed

### 2. FeaturesCard Optimization
- **Countdown timer restored to 1000ms** for accurate countdown display
- Added memoization with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- Extracted countdown logic into custom hook with useRef for better cleanup
- Added React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized timeout handling with useRef
- Removed console.log statements for better performance
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies

### 3. Header Animation Optimization
- Reduced animation frequency from 60fps to 30fps
- Maintained smooth scrolling while improving performance

### 4. Image Optimization
- Added `loading="lazy"` to all images
- Added `decoding="async"` for better image loading
- Images now load only when they come into viewport

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Added `PerformanceMonitor` component for development
- Shows load time in bottom-right corner during development

## Expected Improvements
- **Faster initial load** - Components load progressively
- **Accurate countdown** - Timer runs every second as required
- **Reduced re-renders** - React.memo and optimized hooks prevent unnecessary updates
- **Better memory management** - useRef for proper cleanup of intervals and timeouts
- **Better user experience** - Loading spinners provide feedback
- **Optimized memory usage** - Lazy loading reduces bundle size

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Image compression** - Compress PNG images to WebP format
2. **CDN usage** - Serve images from CDN for faster loading
3. **Bundle analysis** - Use `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies
4. **Caching** - Implement proper caching headers
5. **Service Worker** - Add service worker for offline functionality

## Testing Performance
- Use browser DevTools Performance tab
- Monitor Network tab for loading times
- Check Lighthouse scores for Core Web Vitals
- Use the PerformanceMonitor component in development
